### To View Results & Visualization : Project_Results_Visualization.pdf
### To Create Models : Run, 'CryptoProject_ModelCreation.py', which will create models, scalers, in corrosponding coin_data_directory under data_modelCreation
### To run/predict on models without streamlit : Run, 'CryptoProject_Prediction.py' after runnig 'CryptoProject_ModelCreation.py'
### To run/predict on models with streamlit : Run, 'Streamlit run CryptoProject_Prediction_Streamlit.py', after runnig 'CryptoProject_ModelCreation.py'
### To view LSTM models : data_modelCreation/corrosponding_coin/model.keras and .pkl files for inverse scaling
### To go though data, model, scaler: data_modelCreation
### Ignore : Other Files,  Not important files, creating few different usecases
